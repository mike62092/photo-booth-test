""" photo-box-project
I've created this repository to develop a python language photo-box to use with a raspberry pi 5, raspberry camera module, and a 5inch touchscreen interface.
"photo-box" is the complete, working file that includes a python script utilizing tkinter as a gui for the touchscreen interface. nellie.png and Untitled_Artwork 2.png are assets used for customizing the tkinter gui. "picamera-test.py" and "test-with-date.py" and "test" are python scripts that I have been using to test different features I wanted to include. "photo-box.py" is the completed project utilizing features I explored and tested in the other files.
